If you are looking for a user-friendly R `r emo::ji("package")` for retrieving data from the [B.C. Freshwater Atlas](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/topographic-data/freshwater) please see [fwatlasbc](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fwatlasbc) `r emo::ji("smile")`. It is built on `fwapgr`.

`fwapgr` is an R client for the [fwapg pg-featureserv web API](https://www.hillcrestgeo.ca/fwapg/index.html) used to get data from the [B.C. Freshwater Atlas](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/topographic-data/freshwater). Data are returned as [simple features](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf). Functions and arguments exactly match those available in the API.

Query features from [collections](https://www.hillcrestgeo.ca/fwapg/collections.html):  

* `fwa_collection()`  

Get metadata:  

* `fwa_meta_collections()`  
* `fwa_meta_properties()`  

Execute spatial [functions](https://www.hillcrestgeo.ca/fwapg/functions.html):  

* `fwa_index_point()`  
* `fwa_locate_along()`
* `fwa_locate_along_interval()`
* `fwa_watershed_at_measure()`  
* `fwa_watershed_hex()`  
* `fwa_watershed_stream()`  

## Installation

To install the developmental version from [GitHub](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fwapgr)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/fwapgr")
```

## Demonstration
Get Yakoun River stream from 'whse_basemapping.fwa_stream_networks_sp' collection:
```{r}
yakoun <- fwapgr::fwa_collection("whse_basemapping.fwa_stream_networks_sp", filter = list(gnis_name = 'Yakoun River'))
yakoun[c("blue_line_key", "gnis_name", "length_metre")]
```

Get Yakoun River watershed starting 10km upstream:
```{r}
wshed <- fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(unique(yakoun$blue_line_key), downstream_route_measure = 10000)
```

```{r dpi=300, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = yakoun, lwd = 0.15) +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(data = wshed, lwd = 0.15, fill = 'steelblue', alpha = 0.5)
```

## Credit and Inspiration
`fwapgr` is built on the [fwapg pg-featureserv web API](https://www.hillcrestgeo.ca/fwapg/index.html) hosted and created by [Simon Norris](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) at [Hillcrest Geographics](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/main/). It is meant to succeed the [`fwabc`](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fwabc) `r emo::ji("package")` which retrieved data [via WFS](https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca/geo/pub/wfs?service=WFS&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=WHSE_BASEMAPPING.FWA_LAKES_POLY&outputFormat=json&SRSNAME=epsg%3A3005&CQL_FILTER=GNIS_NAME_1=%27Quamichan%20Lake%27) with the [bcdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata) 📦. 

Many thanks to [Simon Norris](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) for his work on [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) PostgreSQL database and [the pg-featureserv web API](https://www.hillcrestgeo.ca/fwapg/index.html).
